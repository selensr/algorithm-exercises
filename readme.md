# Algorithm Practice Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems that I have encountered in technical interviews and selected from online platforms such as LeetCode. The purpose of sharing these solutions is to help others who are preparing for software engineering interviews and to document my own learning journey in the field of algorithms and data structures.

## Motivation

The challenges included here span a range of topics commonly tested in technical interviews. Each problem is selected to enhance understanding and proficiency in key computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. By sharing my solutions, I aim to provide insights into different approaches to complex problems and foster a community where we can learn from each otherâ€™s approaches and solutions.

## Problem Statements

Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a specific problem. The folders are structured as follows:

- **Problem Description**: A brief description of the problem, outlining the main objective and any relevant constraints.
- **Solution**: My solution to the problem, including the code and a detailed explanation of the logic behind it.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.
